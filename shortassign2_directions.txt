Short Assignment 2
Due November 14th.
1. Initial analysis of your data: a markdown script of what analyses you have run, with included figures of what results you have so far.
2. Should include at least the first analysis we discussed in your one on one meetings - for many of you this is just looking for structure. PCAngsd is fine, or run fastSTRUCTURE, ADMIXTURE, etc.
3. Write-up should include what follow-up analyses are warranted for your end goal. For example - will you need to run demographic analysis? What approaches will you use?
