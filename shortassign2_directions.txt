Short Assignment 2

For this assignment, your goal is to demonstrate you have collected data and have done _some_ preliminary analyses, as well as have a plan for the rest.

Your submission should be a rendered pdf version of an R markdown/Quarto/Jupyter notebook that contains three sections:

1) Introduction and background
Write a brief (~paragraph) introduction of your data set, include references to where you obtained it, and outline the major goals of your analyses. These could be goals for results ("find out the population structure and differentiation of my study system"), or they could be methodological ("learn to generate windowed gene trees using iqTree"), but will help me keep in mind why you chose the data that you did.

2) Current analyses and results

Include both code snippets of what you ran to pre-process/acquire data, as well as whatever commands you've used to run different analyses and their results. If you are using a piece of software/package outside of what we have discussed, include a link to the paper/git repository/website for that software.

Provide a brief reflection of what results you have found. Do they make sense for your system? What do they tell you about the natural history of your system?

This section should include at least one figure/table/result output.

3) Future analyses

What else are you hoping to accomplish with the data now that you have some baseline analyses done? Don't make this list exhaustive - try to stick to 2-3 analyses that you know you can get done, and ideally we'll push you to do more.
